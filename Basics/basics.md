## Important Concepts

1. Everything in Dart that you can place in a variable is an object and inherits the Object class. Functions, numbers and null are also objects.

2. The main function in Dart is a top level entrypoint function to the app. It has a void return type and has an optional List<String> parameter as an argument.
